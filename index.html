      <p>
        Baking for others shows you care. It can be an expression of love,
        appreciation, celebration, and even sympathy. Baking traditionally uses
        eggs, butter, and milk derived from animals, but it is possible to bake
        tasty treats without animal products. When we bake using whole plant
        based foods that are minimally processed we are showing compassion
        towards animals, the planet, and ourselves. Our personal food choices
        have an impact on many beings and I love recreating recipes from my
        childhood without the use of animal products.
